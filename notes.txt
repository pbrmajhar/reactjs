To import firebase we need to go to firebase console and create the a file for firebase and also  
have to install the firebase npm package. 
npm i firebase
and from firebase.js we need to export two things.

export const auth = firebase.auth();
export const googleAuthProvider = new firebase.auth.GoogleAuthProvider();
